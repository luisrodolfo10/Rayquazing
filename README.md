# Rayquazing – Renderer

A custom renderer developed as part of the *Computer Graphics* course at Saarland University.

Rayquazing builds on top of **Lightwave**, an educational framework designed to help students implement their own ray tracers. This project extends Lightwave by adding original features, enhancements, and rendering capabilities — with the goal of producing photo-realistic images through physically-based rendering.

## Based on: Lightwave

> *“Lightwave provides the boring boilerplate, so you can focus on the insightful parts.”*
